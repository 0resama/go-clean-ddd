# Go Clean Architecture Backend

This is a backend template written in Go.
It follows Clean Architecture and Domain-Driven Design.
I chose frameworks like Gin-Gonic, GORM, and Zap to help you get started quickly.
Since it follows clean architecture, you can easily swap out these frameworks later if you want.

```
