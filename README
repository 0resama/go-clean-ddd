# Go Clean Architecture Backend

A backend template written in Go following **Clean Architecture** and **Domain-Driven Design** principles.

Built with modern frameworks including **Gin-Gonic**, **GORM**, and **Zap** to help you get started quickly. The clean architecture design allows you to easily swap out these frameworks later if needed.
